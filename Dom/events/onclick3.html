    Game theory models are classified by all of the options you provided:

- **Sum of all payoffs:** This refers to the outcomes or rewards associated with different combinations of strategies chosen by players in a game. It's a crucial aspect of analyzing and understanding game theory models.

- **Number of strategies:** Games can be classified based on the number of strategies available to each player. This includes games with a finite number of strategies (finite games) as well as games with infinite strategies (continuous games).

- **Number of players:** The number of players in a game is another classification criterion. Games can be classified as single-player (where only one player makes decisions), two-player (bilateral games), or games with multiple players (multiplayer games).

So, all of these criteria contribute to the classification of game theory models.
