Version 

how Versionig works in node.js
let this be the latest ver of express ^4.18.2

1st part -> 4.
2nd part -> 18.
3rd part -> 2.

=> 3rd part (last part) -> Minor fixes, optional update, u can say any typo or minor bug fix hua ho.

=> 2nd part (middle part) -> Recommended update, security or big bug fixes, or adding a new feature which is recommneded to have... mo problem in changing it.

=> 1st part (first part) -> Latest update and breaking update.. dont update into this version for ur existing app, coz it might break due to some changes ur previous version code doesnt know about. 

^carrot symbol which says lock the specfied ver. and update rest, for example ^4.18.2 here 4(lastest update fixes) is locked and rest can get updated automatically.

Advice~
-> we should always see first before chaning into any update
-> after checking we should see which update is best for us.
